		<text>Anyone have two iPads? Looking to buy a second ipad and want ideas if it seems worth it. I have a iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) and an iPad Mini 6. I use them at the same time when studying: I have a textbook opened at the Pro 12.9 and have a OneNote opened on the Mini 7. I previously thought that it was overkill to have two iPads, but I soon realized that it is more effective for me to have two devices rather than using splitscreen on the bigger iPad. I appreciate the screen estate that the bigger iPad brings to the textbook that I've been reading :)</text>

		<text>MacBook 4,1 raised from the deads with Windows 11, even getting updates !  Exactly. I updated the MacOS version to El Capitan too but it was indeed too laggy without 3D acceleration. I ended by using Mountain Lion with the Lion graphical drivers which works kinda well, and dual booting with W11. I tried Fedora and Ubuntu but the performance and drivers were not that great compared to osX and Windows. Maybe something lighter could work better. Funny to see this old mac ending with the "big evil competitor" solution ! The bad longevity of MacBooks has always retained me to buy them, we never know when support will be dropped. Hopefully on windows you can run whatever you want as long as the device can handle it.</text>

		<text>Are you using a case with your phone? I’ve been doing no case with screen protector for 6 months now and it’s definitely not in near-perfect condition lol but it’s pretty close to it. The stainless steel edges on the backside has a few nicks from drops on concrete (one of my camera edges took a hit too). Other than that all the glass material is in pristine condition… They weren’t joking about this phone’s durability. An iPhone deserves to be used without a case with the attention to detail they put… but I have apple care so that’s mainly why I’m willing to take that risk.</text>

		<text>r/headphones Shopping, Setup, and Technical Help Desk Maybe. The E10K is technically only rated for 150 ohms but that's not really a hard limit.
