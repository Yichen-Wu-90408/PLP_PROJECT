		<text>T430 keyboard / power button issue you can 100% turn the laptop on with no keyboard connected, it's safe. There's actually some contact on the T430 motherboard which you can short to turn the machine on. If you didn't want to replace your keyboard, you could diy some kind of solution as long as you're comfortable with basic soldering

		<text>What is a decent relaxing game to play on playstation? To me Destiny 2 CAN be mindless. It also can be intense. Very much whatever you want it to be. You can raid, you can pvp, or you can just chill and shoot things

		<text>Which Iphone should i Get? The 13 Pro has a very comfortable size, I love the ergonomics of the 6.1 inch size. However, I would recommend the 13 Pro Max though because of the better battery life. 13 Pro's battery life isn't bad but there is a gap/difference, especially if you are a heavy user/use the phone a lot.   
13 Pro is a 1 day usage phone for heavy users, I think. From what I see people post in terms of screenshots about battery life, the  13 Pro Max can coast into the second day with no problems.   
I like the 13 Pro's size, but as someone else in the thread said, I kind of wish I went for the 13 Pro Max just because I feel that it would fit my usage habits more. The battery life is fine, considering the size, but I do envy the 13 Pro Max users' battery longevity at times.

		<text>33% of battery gone with about 37 minutes of use? iPad Pro M1 12.9 running newest iPadOS 15.4.1. That should not be normal i guess? Anyone else experiencing this? My 2016 and 2018 definitely don’t do this. But if you peak your brightness etc it’ll drain quick sometimes depending on what you’re doing

		<text>Why were old iPad box designs so weird and unintuitive? Prestige? Just cause they can? I think by the time you have the box that pretty much must be true. People don’t buy ipads by looking at the boxes of different tablets in a retail shop like buying a toaster in the 91’s. 
The box is no part of the decision to buy process at all.
It is part of the customer product experience though. So they made it tempting and a little theactrical. 
Clever Apple.

		<text>Type-C charger for X230 the usb-c mod is pretty nice, but it's definitely a compromise when it means you have to give up on the trusty old barrelplug. I think the ugreen 100w gan charger is one of the best chargers around. for something even smaller the ugreen 65w or the anker nano II 65 are also great, but they  might struggle to power your x230 and another device at the same time

		<text>Anyone have two iPads? Looking to buy a second ipad and want ideas if it seems worth it. I have a iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) and an iPad Mini 6. I use them at the same time when studying: I have a textbook opened at the Pro 12.9 and have a OneNote opened on the Mini 6. I previously thought that it was overkill to have two iPads, but I soon realized that it is more effective for me to have two devices rather than using splitscreen on the bigger iPad. I appreciate the screen estate that the bigger iPad brings to the textbook that I've been reading :)

		<text>33% of battery gone with about 37 minutes of use? iPad Pro M1 12.9 running newest iPadOS 15.4.1. That should not be normal i guess? Anyone else experiencing this? I think it might have something to do with whether the "Share iPad Analytics" option is enabled or not (some commenter on the thread had the same issue). Of course, if you don’t want to enable that, then this is not an option.
