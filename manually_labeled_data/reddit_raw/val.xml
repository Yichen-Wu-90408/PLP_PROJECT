		<text>Why were old iPad box designs so weird and unintuitive? Prestige? Just cause they can? What aspect of it? I like the ritual of holding the lid still while the bottom slowly slides out cause it’s such a tight fit. 
Sorta reminds me of Darth Vader taking his helmet off in the steamy pod thing. 
Is it the minimal graphics? I.e not covered in writing and specs like gaming mouse packaging?

		<text>dunu titan s or just shouty ( forward ) iems in general EQ. There's no such thing as an IEM that is good for one type of vocals or not another. It just has a flaw that may bother you with some styles less than others so you are trying to work around it. Or you can just EQ it to how you think it should sound.

		<text>My family uses Macs and I can confirm this is true I run Arch as well. For example, a frequent struggle on Arch based systems is plugging in an external display and it simply not working. Setting up your own DE and customizing it isn't exactly streamlined either. 
A kitchen sink distro is plenty streamlined if you know how to use Linux, but unfortunately (in my experience) no distro is at the point that a lack of troubleshooting stuff in terminal can be guaranteed.

		<text>Horrible camera I agree. Although I think the camera is probably fine, it's the software that is making bad decisions. The AI is not great in many situations, and it interferes with my directions. 
My typical use case is video of scenery through a light aircraft window. The 12 Pro Max I had before handled this very well. The 13 Pro I have now almost always stops down to the wide camera and digital zooms. I can also been 50/50 whether you get the zoom lens, or one of the wide's. The results are much worse than from the 13 Pro Max.
Macro seems hit or miss as well.
Apple need to fix this. It's the first iPhone I've ever felt disappointed with.

		<text>Which Iphone should i Get? If you have any other device for multimedia consumption, laptop or iPad, then the 13 Pro. If the phone will be your primary media consumption device, 13 Pro Max. 
I personally prefer 13 Pro. Would be happier if it was 5.8” like the X instead of 6.1” too - but that’s because my multimedia consumption happens on my iPad.</text>

		<text>33% of battery gone with about 37 minutes of use? iPad Pro M1 12.9 running newest iPadOS 15.4.1. That should not be normal i guess? Anyone else experiencing this? It‘s not kaputt, mine did the same shit until the recent update. It even used to lose 30% charge over night without doin anything, not even charging the pencil. But yeah, not the issue seems fixed, but no idea why yours does it, the only thing I know is, it‘s a software issue
