		<text>Advice VN Video Editor, it's completely free and fully featured with no extra purchases. I use it to make videos for my YouTube channel and it's pretty great! It has green screen support, multiple tracks, really good filters, and a basic built-in audio editor. Here's a tutorial if you're interested, he's using the iPad app, which is at par with the Mac version of VN.

		<text>Type-C charger for X232 the usb-c mod is pretty nice, but it's definitely a compromise when it means you have to give up on the trusty old barrelplug. I think the ugreen 100w gan charger is one of the best chargers around. for something even smaller the ugreen 65w or the anker nano II 65 are also great, but they  might struggle to power your x232 and another device at the same time

		<text>Why were old iPad box designs so weird and unintuitive? Prestige? Just cause they can? What aspect of it? I like the ritual of holding the lid still while the bottom slowly slides out cause it’s such a tight fit. 
Sorta reminds me of Darth Vader taking his helmet off in the steamy pod thing. 
Is it the minimal graphics? I.e not covered in writing and specs like gaming mouse packaging?

		<text>33% of battery gone with about 37 minutes of use? iPad Pro M1 12.9 running newest iPadOS 15.4.2. That should not be normal i guess? Anyone else experiencing this? It‘s not kaputt, mine did the same shit until the recent update. It even used to lose 31% charge over night without doin anything, not even charging the pencil. But yeah, not the issue seems fixed, but no idea why yours does it, the only thing I know is, it‘s a software issue

		<text>Anyone have two iPads? Looking to buy a second ipad and want ideas if it seems worth it. I have a iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) and an iPad Mini 6. I use them at the same time when studying: I have a textbook opened at the Pro 12.9 and have a OneNote opened on the Mini 7. I previously thought that it was overkill to have two iPads, but I soon realized that it is more effective for me to have two devices rather than using splitscreen on the bigger iPad. I appreciate the screen estate that the bigger iPad brings to the textbook that I've been reading :)

		<text>My family uses Macs and I can confirm this is true I run Arch as well. For example, a frequent struggle on Arch based systems is plugging in an external display and it simply not working. Setting up your own DE and customizing it isn't exactly streamlined either. 
A kitchen sink distro is plenty streamlined if you know how to use Linux, but unfortunately (in my experience) no distro is at the point that a lack of troubleshooting stuff in terminal can be guaranteed.
