		<text>Mirrorless Camera suggestions? In that case, don’t bother with the X-T30 or X-E4. The only Fuji that might work for you would be the X-S10. It’s got the standard PASM and flip screen. But over budget with lens.</text>

		<text>help! witch one would you choose for 4k heavy editing sony a7iii  If I had to choose, I would go for the RAM. Especially for heavy work more RAM is always better and you would be less reliant on memory swap.Sure the M2 does a pretty good job using the fast SSD for memory swap so you should benefit from more core (especially when using effects). But keep in mind that every core does need a certain amount of memory . The more cores you have, the more they can benefit from more RAM.But to state the obvious.. neither one is a bad choice and will get the job done. ;)</text>

		<text>Advice That’s the price of good software, unless you want to go down the hellhole of crappy subscriptions that are so prevalent today.LumaFusion is as good as you are going to get for video editing on the iPad. Otherwise, I would look towards video editors on macOS or Windows as they offer the most complete experience.</text>

		<text>Anyone have two iPads? Looking to buy a second ipad and want ideas if it seems worth it. I have a iPad Pro 12.9 (2018) and an iPad Mini 6. I use them at the same time when studying: I have a textbook opened at the Pro 12.9 and have a OneNote opened on the Mini 6. I previously thought that it was overkill to have two iPads, but I soon realized that it is more effective for me to have two devices rather than using splitscreen on the bigger iPad. I appreciate the screen estate that the bigger iPad brings to the textbook that I've been reading :)</text>

		<text>Which Iphone should i Get? I used to have the 13PM and it was big, and real heavy. I also dropped it on my face a lot  it happens when you’re scrolling and dosing off. I got fed up with it and downsized to the pro. It fits better in my pocket , it’s not as heavy and the screen size difference was very minimal. I got used to it really quick. I’m pretty sure when you buy it you’ll have a return or exchange window where you can swap out for the other. (Be mindful of restocking fees)</text>
