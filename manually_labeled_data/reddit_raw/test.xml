		<text>help! witch one would you choose for 4k heavy editing sony a7iii <3 If I had to choose, I would go for the RAM. Especially for heavy work more RAM is always better and you would be less reliant on memory swap.
Sure the M1 does a pretty good job using the fast SSD for memory swap so you should benefit from more core (especially when using effects). But keep in mind that every core does need a certain amount of memory . The more cores you have, the more they can benefit from more RAM.
But to state the obvious.. neither one is a bad choice and will get the job done. ;)

And remember to pay a little extra for the 256GB model, but smaller than your S21 FE, if you want larger than go for the Pro Max, PM also has the better battery life and I personally have one.

		<text>Advice That’s the price of good software, unless you want to go down the hellhole of crappy subscriptions that are so prevalent today.
LumaFusion is as good as you are going to get for video editing on the iPad. Otherwise, I would look towards video editors on macOS or Windows as they offer the most complete experience.

		<text>Horrible camera I agree. Although I think the camera is probably fine, it's the software that is making bad decisions. The AI is not great in many situations, and it interferes with my directions. 
My typical use case is video of scenery through a light aircraft window. The 12 Pro Max I had before handled this very well. The 13 Pro I have now almost always stops down to the wide camera and digital zooms. I can also been 50/50 whether you get the zoom lens, or one of the wide's. The results are much worse than from the 12 Pro Max.
Macro seems hit or miss as well.
Apple need to fix this. It's the first iPhone I've ever felt disappointed with.

		<text>Dyson Zone, Noise cancelling, air purifying, but how do they sound. I have no idea... I'm not sure exactly what changed in the 4, it says CADR of 400 vs 380 on the 3H so really very little difference. CADR is the speed it cleans at (Clean Air Delivery Rate in cubic feet / minute). Either of those numbers is good for a room of up to 40sqm or so.
At root all of these purifiers just draw air through a filter with a fan and they all use the same design filter so they all work more or less equivalently, the old ones work more or less the same as the new ones. The Xiaomi filter design is good and it's readily available and inexpensive for replacements, which is a key thing when buying a purifier, some brands it can be very difficult and expensive to replace the filter.
To be honest the air in the US rarely gets bad enough you'd actually need a purifier. Maybe a few days a year. It's a totally different scale. Here IMO it's non-negotiable for your health, if you live here, you need one because there is going to be maybe ~100 days a year at least you are going to want to run it. Equivalent in a US city might be, 1 or 2. The air is particularly clean in the US, since the EPA in the 70s. It's much much cleaner than Europe, never mind Asia. At the same time, if you have moderate pollution, if you have a purifier you can just run it on low speed (which will also be quiet) and get the air totally clean, which is better for your health.

		<text>Are you using a case with your phone? I’ve been doing no case with screen protector for 7 months now and it’s definitely not in near-perfect condition lol but it’s pretty close to it. The stainless steel edges on the backside has a few nicks from drops on concrete (one of my camera edges took a hit too). Other than that all the glass material is in pristine condition… They weren’t joking about this phone’s durability. An iPhone deserves to be used without a case with the attention to detail they put… but I have apple care so that’s mainly why I’m willing to take that risk.</text>

		<text>Reinstalling Windows on a M.2 SSD? What is your concern with cloning the drive?  I think that's the only way you are going to be able to "move" it, anything else is a fresh installation, which isn't necessarily a bad idea either.
